## Description

This is application is a prompt-and-response based application which uses node.js to prompt the user with questions at the command line. It takes the user input and uses it to create a list of interview questions, with notes about what each question is intended for and what to watch for in the employers response.

In an interview, it's sometimes hard to recall things you previously intended to saying, because it's a stressfull situation. It's also sometime hard to know what questions to ask in order to fish for/suss out red flags that might be correlated with an unpleasant, or unprofitable, employment experience. By having the machine provide promopts, it solves that "interview question creativity" issue, so you don't have to be an interview expert to do well in an interview. Having those answers concatenated into an interview prep document saves time and allows the user to focus on more important things.
